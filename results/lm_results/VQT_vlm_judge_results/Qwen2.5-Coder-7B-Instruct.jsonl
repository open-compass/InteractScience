It does not show an initial rise to a peak at t=25; instead, it begins to decrease linearly from t=0."}, {"expectation": "Given 'Number of constant pace wedges' is 4, the purple curve, after peaking, must decrease linearly until it reaches the floor value of 150 (100 * E_floor), which occurs at approximately t=119 years. For t>119, the curve should be a flat line at y=150.", "score": 3, "reason": "The generated curve shows a linear decrease to a flat floor at the correct value of y=150. However, the timing is incorrect; the decrease starts at t=0 (not t=25) and it flattens around t=125 (not t=119)."}, {"expectation": "After peaking, the blue curve (atmospheric carbon) should begin to decay towards the long-term equilibrium value of 886 GtC (calculated as C_eq + E_floor * t_res). It should not become a perfectly horizontal line at a value significantly different from this equilibrium.", "score": 2, "reason": "While the blue curve follows a general rise-peak-decay shape, it is mostly incorrect quantitatively. It peaks much too high (at ~1220, incorrectly overshooting the target ceiling) and too late (around t=95 vs. ~t=75 in the reference). This represents a significant scientific error in the model's output."}]}, "overall_score": 2.4285714285714284}
